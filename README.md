# Enrique Labre bxsci-cord-19 NLP project

Hey people! This is my first NLP project in which I make a question answering model for the CORD-19 dataset to be able to answer COVID-19 questions. Currently I have made pretrained embeddings for the dataset, but the next step is now to fine tune a BERT-for-question-answering model so that we can start answering some questions.
